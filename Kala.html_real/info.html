    <!--Description of Kala's background-->
    <p>Kala sadly grew up on the streets of Texas with her sister. Luckily there were some people that took in Kala and
        her sister. My mom and I just randomly decided to go online and look for a new dog. We found a listing for Kala
        and she looked so sad, after a bit of messaging back and forth, we decided to get her. My grandparents wanted to
        get her sister but unfortunately she was adopted just a few days earlier. Fast forward to today and she is a
        happy puppy in a loving home!</p>
