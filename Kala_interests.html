            "Kala loves to play with her toys, one of her favorite things to do when playing is chase a laser pointer
            like a cat! Even if we say the word laser she starts to get excited and will look on the ground for the
            little red dot!"

        <li class="KalaInterestsList">
            "Another thing Kala loves is exploring, this could include walks, areas of the house after moving around
            furniture, running around outside and at our property! When she is exploring at our property she will
            sometimes dissapear for hours, it worries me sometimes but she always makes it back! I recently got
            certified to fly drones so next time we go camping I'm going to watch her explore from the air!"

        <li class="KalaInterestsList">
            "The last thing Kala likes doing that I'm going to cover is car rides! She is like every other dog and loves
            them, she does great in the car and as soon as a window gets rolled down even a little, she sticks her nose
            right out it!"
