    <!--Start of interesting facts about Kala-->
    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>A few of Kala's interests<i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="KalaInterestsList">
            Kala loves to play with her toys, one of her favorite things to do when playing is chase a laser pointer
            like a cat! Even if we say the word laser she starts to get excited and will look on the ground for the
            little red dot!
        </li>
        <li class="KalaInterestsList">
            Another thing Kala loves is exploring, this could include walks, areas of the house after moving around
            furniture, running around outside and at our property! When she is exploring at our property she will
            sometimes dissapear for hours, it worries me sometimes but she always makes it back! I recently got
            certified to fly drones so next time we go camping I'm going to watch her explore from the air!
        </li>
        <li class="KalaInterestsList">
            The last thing Kala likes doing that I'm going to cover is car rides! She is like every other dog and loves
            them, she does great in the car and as soon as a window gets rolled down even a little, she sticks her nose
            right out it!
        </li>
        <li class="KalaInterestsList">
            Kala also loves going to the beach! We haven't been for a few years but it's one of her favorite places to
            go! Whenever we go she love to hop around in the water and then roll around in the sand, it's often quite
            the mess to clean up. At the end of the day though it's always worth it, she is always so happy to go and
            smell all the new fun stuff while playing in the water and sand!
        </li>
        <li class="KalaInterestsList">
            One thing that Kala loves even more than the beach is the snow! It's really funny watching her move through
            it when it's a couple feet high becasue she'll jump her way through the snow, stop every onece in awhile to
            take a look around, and then continuing to jump to her destination. Another thing she really likes to do in
            the snow is to open her mouth and shovel the snow through it. She never eats it, just gets large amounts to
            run through her mouth. I've never understood why but it's always quite funny! The last thing she really
            likes about the snow is bits of ice, she's one of the dogs that likes to chew on it. The snow is one of her
            favorite times of the year and it's really unfortunate it doesn't last longer in Washington.
